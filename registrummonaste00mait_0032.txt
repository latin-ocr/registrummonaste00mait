derivo benefit from such materiale as compose the Scottish chartularies. He will find
there the oldest writings that have been preserved, and some that may be fairly esteem-
ed contemporary with the first grants of land, perhaps with the first use of writing, in
Scotland‚—containing the details of the foundation of religious houses, which may be
called the first step in civilization, and marking their rapid acquisition of wealth, until
the church accuinulated property disproportioned to the narrowness of the country, and
formed a counterbalance to the whole power of the aristocracy. Such of these records
as extend back to a high antiquity, afford the surest information on the much vexed
question of the successive settlers of the different districts of Scotland; and if they do
not furnish a consistent and unimpugnable system, will at least, if fairly studied, enable
us to avoid the confident and rash assei-tiens of contending theorists, while we trace
with sufficient accuracy the gradual disappcarance of the native inferior race before the
more energetic strangers, and the partial prevalence and more unaccountable extinction
of a system of servitude exercised by the new lords over the original inhabitants of the soil.

The incidental occurrence of traits of manners, and notices of the mode of life of a
period unillustrated by contemporary literature, gives an interest to these records perhaps
even greater than the occasional mention of public events. In particular, they form a
mine of nnexplored materials for illustrating the monastic life, in times when the mo-
nastery furnished not only the statesman, the lawyer‚ the chronicler, and the keeper of
the conscienccs of the people, but the only architects, gardeners, and rnral improvers, as
well as probably the chief artists and artisans.t While the grants of property bring us
more immediately into contact with the lords of the soil, we meet at the same time with
minute descriptions of the dwellings of the agricultural populati0n‚ intimations of their
modes of tillage and pasturage, the early formation of roads and bridges, the vehicles
and modes of conveyance and travelling, the customs, privileges, and restrictions of hunt-
ἰῆς and fishing—-at a time when the former was the distinction of the noble, and the
latter furnished an important part of the subsistence of the people,—the varying prices
of provisions and other staple articles, the changes in the value of money, and a

[Α buu of Pope John XIX. (1032) granting a
general confirmation and protectior] to the Cluniae
order, affords so beautiful an idea of the intention of the
monastic life, that it has been thought allowable, though
soniewhat out of place, to subjoin a short extract from
it. It should be premised, that the buu rests on
questionable authority, though Duchesne admits its au·
themidem butas it is of undoubted high antiquity, it
matters little whether it expresses the Pope's opinion, or
that of some more benevolent and enlightened indivi-
dual, concerning the true duties and virtues of the mo-
nastery. ί Idem locus omnibus ad se ob salutem confu-
