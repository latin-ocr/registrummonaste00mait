in Parhament, 'as early as we have any notice of the persons forming the cederunt of
the Scottish Pal-liaments. .

The property of the Abbey, derived chiefly from the grants of the first three Stewards
and their dependants, and from the earlier members of the two great families of the
Isles and Lennox, was not materially increased in later times.h

An imperfect and inaccurate list of the successive Priors and Abbots of Paisley,⁵ is
given by Crawfurd in his History of Renfrewshire, and with only less inaccuracy by
father Hay in a breve chronicon appended to his transcript of the Chartularyst John
Hammon, the last ordained Abbot, elected in 1525, resigned the abbacy on being raised
to the Archbishoprick of St Andrews, in favour of his nephew the Lord Claud Ha·
milton, fourth son of J ames second Earl of Ari-an, who after an interrupted possession
as commendator, had a chartei· of the Lordship of Paisley with the dignity of a Lord
of Parliament‚ 29th J uly 1587. The Abbey and Lordship continued the property of
his descendants, till sold by J ames second Earl of Abercorn to the Earl of Ang11S‚ srom
whom it was purchased by william first Lord Cochrane of Dundonald in 1653 for
L.160‚000 Scots. The family of Dundonald held the Lordship‚ and chiefly resided at
Paisley‚ for more than a century, until in 1764 it was again sold by Thomas eighth Earl
of Dundonald, to J ames eighth Earl of Abercorn, in whose family it still continues.

Ιι It was intended to give here seme account of the
extent and value of the property of the Abbey. As,
however, the principal materials for such an account,
must have been drawn from the old rental book of the
Abbey, which can hardly fail to atti-act the attention of
some contributor to the Maitland Cluh, it has been
thought injudicious to anticipate hy a partial abstract,
the full publication of a document of great statistical
importance and much local interest. That volume,
which is preserved in the Advocates Library, contaIns
rentals of the Abbacy from 1460 to 1529, several of
them incomplete, but two or three which give the whole
lands, and the ternis on which they were held by the
tenants. On nages 87 and 88 is a code of regulations
to be observed by the tenants of the Abbey, affording
a curious picture of the state of the Scottishltenantry
at the period.

i 'rwo of these deservo to be had in remembrance,
—Thomas Tarvas, a person in high estimation and
much employed in public affairs, and whose benefac-
tions to the Abbey are th us recorded by a contemporary,
and as it would seem a neighbouring chronicler. “ The
yer of God MCCCCLIX, the penult day of Junii,
decessit at Paslay Thomas Tarvas Abhot of Paslay,
1119 quhilk was ane richt gud man, and helplyk to the
place of ony that ever was. For he did mony notable
«bingis, and held ane noble hous, and was ay wele
purvnit. He fand the place all out of gud rewle and
destitut of leving, and all the kirkis in lor-dis bandis,
and the Kirk unbiggit. The body of the kirk fra the
bricht stair up he biggit, and put on the ruf and

tlieckit it with sclait, and riggit it with stane, and
biggit ane gret porcioun of the steph, and ane staitlie
yet-lions, and brot-ht hame mony gud jowellis, and
claihis of gold, silver and silk, and inony gud bnkis,
and maid staitlie stallis, and glasynit mekle of all the
kirk, and brocht hante the staitliest tabernakle that was
in all Scotlnnd, and the mast costlie. And schortlie
he brocht all the placeto fredome, and fra nocht tiu
ane mychti place, and left it out of all kynd of det,
and at all fredomc till dispone as thaim lykit3 and left
ane of the best myteris that was in Scmland, and
chandillaris of silver, and ane lettren of bras», with mony
uthir gud jowellis.”—Auchinlelc Chronicle.

The other was Abbot George Schaw, who obtained
from Pope Sixtus IV. authority to grant leases and
feu· rights for the purpose of founding the town of Pais—
ley, (p. 258, 2640 and to whom king James 1V.
granted the charter of erection of the borongh, on ac·-
count of the singular love and favour which he bore
him, and chiefly for his faithful service in the charge
and education of his dean-est brother, dames Duke of
Ross, in his tender age, (p. *263 ς) and who was scarce-
ly less celebrated for the wall which hc built round the
Abbey precincts, which continued until comparatively
a recent period, the admiration of the country.—
Crawswd's and Ilamillon's mustea-skire.

The rental book of l'aisley furnishes informativi:
concerning several of the Abbots‚ with the assistance
of which, it may be possible to give a complete and
correct list of them.
