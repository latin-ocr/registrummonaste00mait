sulness in filling up the meagre details of early history. Forming their opinions from the
working of civilized society, they overlook how much depends, among a rude people,
upon the influence of individual character and actions, as well as the necessity of draw-
ing from the more definite facts of family history, in conjunction with the ascertained
average length of life, an accuracy of dates and of the calculation of epochs, which will
in vain be sought for in the ancient chronicler.

It must not be supposed from the Chartularies being thus spoken of in the aggregate,
that these records are of the same degree of authority, or of nearly equal weight. The
Registers of Scottish religious houses may be said to hold all ranks from the full evi-
dence of a record of high antiquity, corroborated by the preservation of many of the
original documents from which it had been constructcd, to the questionable authority
of a twice or thrice copied manuscript, of which the materials have altogether perished.
Although the subject of the latter may be, of its nature, as important as that of the for-
mer, it is of course less interesting and, for many of the objects of study that have been
pointed out, infinitely less useful ; and perhaps this distinction affords the best rule for
the mode of publishing these records. there the manuscript is of sufficient antiquity
to claim somewhat of the authority of a writing contemporary with the most important
(leeds recorded,—-still more where the original writs or part of them are preserved, it
seems to be the editor-'s duty to give, as nearly as printing will allow, a correct represent-
ation of the words and letters used by the writer, without supplying or lengthening, and
without the gloss of conjectura] punctuation, that the authority of the record itself may
be transferred to the publication. On the other hand, when the manuscript is a com-
paratively recent transcript, not approaching the orthography of the original ‹locuments,
and pointed ignorantly or rashly, it appears absurd to adopt the imper-sections which
add nothing to its authority or character of genuineness. Although the Chartulary of
Paisley boasts a respectable antiquity, it evidently falls under the latter class. The
writer has not pretended to represent the orthography of his earlier materials, the sys-
tem of pointing, as well as the forms of contraction, are uniform, from the charters of
the reign of Malcolm IV. down to the latest deeds entered in the Register. It appear-
ed in this instance, therefore, to be desii-able to prefer the meaning of the writer where
that was obvious, to his errors of negligence or evident misconceptions of his original,
and so far as possible to make him furnish his own correction, by collating with the
faulty passage the same deed or the same formula occurring in a different part of his
compilation.

As the manifest errors of the manuscript have in many instances been thus silently
superseded in the text, by what appeared to be a more correct and intelligible reading, it
has been deemed fit to annex a list of all such corrections. In other cases where the
reading of the manuscript, although apparently erroneous, has been adopted in the text,
