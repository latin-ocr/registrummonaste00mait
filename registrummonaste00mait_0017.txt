v

venerable breviary states that ‘ full of miracles and sanctity, he fell asleep in the Lord
at Paisley, and the church there was dedicated to his honour!

There seems reason to believe, that Paisley was not the first situation of the new
convent. A chartei· of Malcolm confirms a grant of Walter the founder to the monks
of St. Milburga of VVenlock, of the Cluniae order, seated at the church of St. Mary
and St. James in the inch beside Renfrew ;2 and a recorded charter of Walter him-
self, grants to the monks of Paisley, among other property in Renstew, ‘⁶ terram quam
monachi prius habitaveruntl's It is certain however that within a very short time,
and probably before the death of King Malcolm, the new colony was settled in its
permanent abode.

Tbough munificently endowed by its founder, who also purchased by a grant of
lands its independence of the mother house of VVenlock, and the right of appointing a
superior, which he reserved to himself, Paisley continued for more thau eighty years
after its institution, in the secondary rank of monastic societios, being denied by the
head of the order the privileges of au abbot's government, to the great detriment of the
monks, who were thus debarred of the means of making regular profession aud receiving
canonical benedictinus! Repeated complaints were made of this grievance, not without
allegations that Humbald the prior of Wenlock had overreached the Steward iu their
transaction, and had at least concealed the defect in the constitution of the convent.
At length, in the year 1245‚* the superior house of Cluny, probably induced by au
attempt of the Cistercians to establish themselves in the rich foundation, yielded to the
entreaties of the Bishop of Glasgow and other Scottish bishops then at Lyons, and con-
sented to the election of an abbot by the monks of Paisley, which privilege had been
sometime before conferred conditionally by Pope Honorius ΙΙΙ. at the desire of the
king and lValter bishop of Glasgow. A century later (probably in the year 1334‚)
pope Benedict XII. granted to the abbot the privilege of using a mitre and ring, the
insignia of a bishop, and of exercising the episcopal functions in all churches aud other
places subject to the Monastery; and we find the abbot of Paisley sitting as a prelate

lluw jealously the head of the order of Cluny
asgerted his superiority over the other houses of the
Offlffl', is seen from a bull of Pope Lucius ΙΙ, 1141,
preserved in the Roman collection. It is addressed to
Peoer Abbot of Cluny, and ordains ‘in omnibus prio-
ratibus et cellis quae sine proprio Abbate vestro regimi-

atus sibi subjectos exactionibus ct extorsionibus con-
sueverunt adeo aggravare, quod in eisdem prioratibus
antiquus et consuetus monachorum numerus est nimium
diminutuS, nos id de cetero fieri sub attestatione divini
judicii prohibemus injungentes dicto Abbati Clunia-
censi et aliis abbatibus et prioribus ejusdem ordinis,
in virtute sanctae obedientiae, ut deinceps novos census

ni subjecta sunt, nullus futuris uuquam temporibus
Abbatem ordinare presumat, sed tam prioratus ipsi et
cellae, quam et cetera in quibuslibet locis onmia quibus
cluniacensis ecclesia investita erat‚...tam tibi quani
successoribus tuis in pace semper et quiete servianum*
The following passage of a bull of Nicholas IV. 1289,
shews that this extensive jurisdiction had been some-
what tyrannically exercised. ⁶ Quoniam Abbas Clunia-
censis necnon Abbates et Priores ejusdem ordinis, priora

subjectis sibi prioratibus vel decanatibus non imponant,
absque licentia sedis apostolicae speciali ς cum liqueat
prioratus ipsos non ad destructionem sed ad conserva-
tionem ordinis et correctionem sibi esse subjectos, et
eisdem prioratibus, pro sustentatione monachorum inibi
domino famulantium, possessiones pia devotione fide-
lium fuisse concessas)
