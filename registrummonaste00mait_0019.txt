The Register of the Monastery of Paisley, preserved in the Library of Advocates at
Edinburgh, from which the present work is printed, is a manuscript on paper of a small
folio size, consisting of 274 leaves, written in a uniform character apparently of the
earlier part of the 16tl1 Century. The pages have been ruled in a faint ink, so accu—
rately and with so much uniformity, (each page containing twenty-eight lines,) as to
leave little doubt that the operation was performed by means of a frame or machine, of
which some marks remain. Although its present binding is comparatively recent, it
would appear that the sheets were. made up into a book before the scribe performed his
work, as helias left two commencemeuts, which appear to have been unsatisfactory,
previous to the beginning of the record as it now stands completed, aud not included
in the numbering of the leaves of the volume. It is remarkable that the unsuccessful
attempts, as well as the actual register, commellce in the same order, and strangely
take the foundation charter only second,-suggesting the suspicion that this manuscript
is only a transcript of a record of higher antiquity, in which such an arrangement had
been accidentally adopted. It was indeed so much the custom from a very carly pe-
riod, to record the charters of religious houses, that it appears highly probable the
earlier part was copied from some previous collecti0n; but the character in which it is
written, corresponding with the dates of the later deeds, leayes no l'oonl to suppose that
this part of the work was taken from any other source than the original ‹locuments
The Chartulary must have passed into the hands of the Dundonald family when they
became proprietors of the Abbey and lordship of Paisley, as we find the writers of the
earlier part of the last Century, constantly quoting it as in their possession!

Although it may be questioned whether the Register now preserved was really the
book of record of the Monasteryffl it does not appear that any chartulary of Paisley in a
more ancient shape has been known to our historians and antiquaries. Richard Augus-
tin Hay of Drumboote, a canon of St Genevieve, who made a collection of Scottish
chartersn in the year ]696‚ the third volume of which contains the charters of the Ab·
bey of Paisley, appears to have used this manuscript as his text, altering the order of
the documents to suit his ideas of chronology, but neither omitting any thing nor adding
to its contents.⁰ Sir J ames Dalrymple, who began to form his collections concerning
