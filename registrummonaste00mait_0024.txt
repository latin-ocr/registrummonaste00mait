of an independent Abbot, and of grants of lands and churches iu its favour by the
three first stewards.w In addition to its own proper importance, this partos the
Register has derived a high degree of interest from the light which it throws on the
early history and descent of the family of Stewart. It has been said that the great
exploit of Walter, the first Steward, was founding the Abbey of Paisley31‘ perhaps it
might be more correctly called the one of his acts of which the record has been best
preserved; and in an investigation founded on so small a body of facts, the most minute
circumstance is not to be overlooked. It may be remarked that the English origin
of that family is supported by an exchange which took place between the Priory of
Wenloc and the first Steward. He had originally covenanted to give the house of
Wenloc, in consideration of its obtaining certain privileges for his new foundation, a
tenement in his burgh of Βοιώ-ων, with extensive rights of fishingy This grant
was probably found inconveniently distant from the monastery, and the parties agreed
to an excambion of the possessions in Renfrew, for property in Menewde,—a name
which seems to bear no affinity to any place in Scothmd, nor does the Priory of
Wenloc appear to have continued to possess any property in this kingdom. It is pro-
bable that the situation of the property given in exchange to the Prior was not very
distant from his monastery, and if a conjecture may be hazarded on so slight a founda-
tion as the similarity of names, that place may have been lllynyv, the ancient name
of the Welsh Bishopric of St. Davids, written in English splenem, and Latinized
Menevia; any of which forms might, in the hands of an ignorant transcriber, assume
the shape of the name in our chister. It is by no means improbable, that the Lords of
Oswestry had possessions round St. Davids, where a powerful colony of the Norman
conquerors of England had established themselves before the date of this tmusactionz

The next eighteen charters relate to the foundation and endowment by lValter, the
second 0f that name Steward of Seotland, of a house of Canons and Nuus of the
order of Sempringham at Dalmulin on the river Air, and of the subsequent transfe-
rence of their possessions to the Mouastery of Paisley.a It will be observed‚ that by
the terms of the convention between Sempringham and Paisley,b all the deeds granted
in favour of Dalmulin were made over to the Abbey; and wc have here, probably, the
whole muniments of that short-lived institution.
