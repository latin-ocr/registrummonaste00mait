tionffl (probably attributable to the error of the printer‚) those references correspond with
the folios of our Register. But of all the writers on Scottish antiquities‚ none have
drawn their materiale so largely from the Chartulary of Paisley‚ as Geor-ge Craw-
furd, and it is therefore peculiarly important to ascertain what record or copy was
used by him. Fortunately he leaves no doubt of the identity of his authority with
our Register, by repeatedly quoting it as in the possession of the Earl of Dundonald,
although the extreme inaccuracy of his description of this recorda and of liis occasional
particular references to its foIios, might otherwise create a doubt on the subject. Sir
Robert Douglas in his Peerage frequently quotes the Chartulary of Paisley‚ sometimes
as the property of the Earl of Dundonald, sometimes as 111 the hands of Macfarlan tho

notations concerning the institution of monachism, and
especially the order of St Benedict ς ‘ Breve Chronicon
Paslecensis ubbaaeioe,·-a meagre and incorrect sketch
ofthe foundation and the series ofits abbotS‚—-apparent-
ly compiled by Hay himself; and ‘ Stemma Senescutli
Scotiae et MS. codicibus,' principally directed to the
proofs of the legitimacy of Robert ΙΙΙ. Aequitting
father Hay of any intention to deceive, it is very diffi-
cult m account for the way in which he describes his
Chartulary of Paisley, placing it on a footing in point
of authority with ‘my Lord Dundonald's copy.' If
it is allowed to conjecture, the collection formed at his
expense and for his use, being made while he was
abroml, was perhaps occasionally taken from sources
with which he was unacquainted, and his copyist, who
from some trifling errors appears to have been a foreigner,
may have transcribed the volume of Paisley charters
from the Chartulary of Lord Dandonem, without suf-
ficiently explaining the original which he followed.
But be that as it may, it appears only short of absolute
certainty, that the Chartulary of Paisley quoted by
father Hay as in his own librnry, was the third vo-
hune of the veterum diplomatum collectio now iu the
Advocatcs Libram, and that that volume is a manscript,
111 a new order, of the Register from which the present
work is printed.

q It is in these terius, “ My best acknowledgemems
are ever due to the Right Honourable John Earl of
Dundonald, who was pleased to allow me the perusal
of the Register of the Monastery of Pasly‚ by which
I had some special advantages of discovering the anti-
quities of the most of the noble and ancient families in
the Shire of Renfrew, and of the illustrious family of
Stewart. Having so often mentioned the Register or
Chartulary of Pasly, 1 shall presume so sar upon the
reader's patience, as to give a brief account of the same.
Iu the old monasteries of Scotland there were three sort
of Register books; 35, Ἰ. Α general one, which by
way of annals or chronicle, gave the yearly occurrences

relating to the public. 11. Their obitum-ies, wherein
were recorded the times of the death and 1110 places 01·
interment of their A11b01s‚ Priors, and other great men
of their respective houses, and their chief benefactore.
111. Their Chartulary or Regimen wherein were rc..
cordcd the charters of the Kings, aud other great men,
bulls of the Popes, and the more private granis of in-
fcriour bcnefamors, which had passed 111 their favours,
such as this book I 3111 now 10 give account of, which
is a large folio, all writ 011 Lombard pap‹r‚ in a fair
legible hand. The first leaf begins with an alphabe-
tical index of all the charters therein contained. Then
follows the charter of foundation, which is confirmed
by the Pope's bull‚ with another froin King william,
as also several privileges and exemptions from the
bishops of Glasgow, Argile, and the 15105. 'rhen we
have through the whole book pronliscuously‚ Popesbulls,
111-31115 from the Sovereigns, and donations os the High
Stewards of Scotland‚ who were its patrous and greatest
benefactors. In the 161 leaf we have carta erectionis
villae (ἵε Pasleto in liberum burgum, by King James
IV. anno 1488 ; the grounds of the erectiori are his
devotion to St. Mirin the holy confessor, and his high
love 31111 respect to the venerable father, George Shaw
Abbot of the Monastery of Pasly. Theu we have se-
veral granis by the Abbots to their vassals‚ brought down
to the year 15⁴5.” It may serve 35 3 useful warning
against placing implicit confidence in this author's ac-
euracy, to point out the singular conibination of mis-
takes contained in this passage. The general account
of the three 50115 of registers, which cannot be held as
applicable to all Scottish monasteries‚ nor perhaps was
exactly true of any, 15 copied verbatim from Nicol-
son's Historical Library. With regard to the particular
description of the Chartulary of Paisley, uhich from
its minuteness might be expected to be accurate,-so
far from being a large folio, it is, although certainly
asolio in shape‚ of so small a size, as to lead Father
