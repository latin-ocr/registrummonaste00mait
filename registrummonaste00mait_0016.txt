conquest, and had several establishments in that country. Of these, the Priory of
WVenlock was founded by Roget the great Earl of Montgomery‚ on the ruins, it was
said, of a former convent, where Milburga, grand-daughter of Penda Saxon king of
Mercia, had presided and was buried in the odour of sanctity. Her tomb, which
had been neglected and forgotten since the coming in of the Normans, was accidentally
discovered in building the new monastery, by the balsamic perfume issuing from it;
and numerous miracles wrought by her relies, with crowds of pilgrims flocking to her
shrine, soon brought the Saxon saint and eonsequently her place of intermeat into such
repnte, that the foreign monks conciliated the natives by taking her for their patroness.
A century after, the colony from W enloek carried with it to Paisley the same reverence
for its patron saint, and the new monastery was dedicated to her, together with Saint
J 311195, the patron of an older church where the new 111011115- 113(1 first settled, and Saint
Mirinus, Bishop and Confessor, whose history also speaks the country of his origin.
This other peculiar patron Saint of Paisley was educated, says the Scottis-11 Bre-
viary,⁶ under Saint Congallus in the Abbey of Bangour. Resisting the temptations of
wealth and rank to which he was born, he. devoted himself to a monastic life, and be-
came Prior of the Monastery of Bangour, under the Abbot Cougallus. Nothing more
of his life is added by this apocryphal chroniele, except the details of a few of his mi-
racles, which are notin general distinguished by much originality. At 0119 time, a
holy Bishop, a guest in the abbey, requiriug milk propter molliorcm sui corporis qua-
litatem, when there was nom¹ in the monastery, it was miraculously supplied by the
intervention of Mirinus. On another occasion, he restored by his prayers one of his
brethren who had fallen down from extreme labour and thirst, after he had lain lifeless
for many hom-s. A third exertiou of the Saint's miraculous powers is somewhat more
singular. Travelling on 3 religious mission, he arrived at the castle of the King of
Ireland, and prayed to be admitted. It happened that the queen was then in the pains
of childbirth, and on that account or for other reasons the Saint was denied admit-
tance and treated with disrespeet3 upon which, departing in indignation, he intreated
of heaven that the King might suffer the pains of labour instead of his wife. This
fearful malediction was immediately fulfilled, so that for three days and nights the
miserable monarch was heard by all the subjects of his kingdom to cry incessantly like
a woman in travail, until at length, finding all remedies of physicians vain, he took
means to appease the saint, aud was hy him delivered from his sufferings. We are
not informed when Mirinus became a bishop, nor even at what time he lived‚d but the
