The lawyer has long recognised these Church Registers as valuable collections of
ancient styles, even when a portion of the record was not set apart for that purpose.
The mode of conveyance and transmission of property in early times, showing, by its
similarity to the conveyaucing of Eugland and the continent of Europe, a common
and certainly an Italian origin3 the gradual development of the feudal tenures; the
discussion aud settlement of legal disputes; the scattered notices of forgotten courts and
judicatums, and their forms of procedure often wonderfully systematic and accurate,
contrasted with the wordy and involved style of church forms in the century preceding
the Reformati0n,—present very curious subjects of study for the legal antiquary3 while,
to the student of language, these transcripts, themselves of vener-able antiquity, of docu-
ments far more early than any other reeords, give valuable assistance. The names of
the great features of the country, with the minuter divisions and landmarks contain-
ed in bounding charters preserving the original orthography, the frequent occurrence of
descriptions and phrases in the vulgar lang-uage of the district, accompanied sometimes
with translations into Latin, may be said to allow us to traco our strangely mixed
language to one at least of its great sources3 for these, in conjunctior] with the re-
ciprocal adoption of surnames from land, and the nomenclature of places from their early
settlers, carry us back to the first intercourse between our country and the Norman
conquerors of England‚ while, in remote districts, we seem to observe traces of earlier
German or Scaudinavian settlers‚ pushing back the native inhabitants, and importing
their speech as well as their manners, arts and arms.

It is a very common mistakc to imagine that genealogica] information alone is to be
derived from this sourcefl Even if that impression were correct, it would not war-
rant their entire neglect. The study of genealogy has fallen into disrepute and con-
tempt not altogether justly, in part from the base purposes to which it is occasionally
turned, but more from its being so frequently raised into the importance of an end and
object of research instead of serving as a road of connexion and guidance to the his-
torian, the antiquary and the chronologist. Without wishing to claim undue impor-
tance for a very captivating pursuit, it may be questioned whether those who so much
undervalue the study of the succession of familieS, have sufficientlyrconsidered its use-
