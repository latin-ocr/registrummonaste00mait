the Scottish History, soon after the publication of Lloyd's historical account of the Bri-
tish churehes, (1684‚) makes numerous references to the Chai-tulary of Paisley in the
possession of the Earl of Dundonald as a record of known authenticity‚ and without

alluding to the existence of any other copy.

With that precision which he was almost

the first to introduce into the discussion of Scottish antiquities, he uniformly refers to
the folio of the Chartulary where the chartei· quoted occule, and with a single excep-

rescripts contained in this Register, only two have pre-
served the formal attestation of the Pope and Cardinals,
with a representation of the papal seal or bulla ε The
same bulls, and no others, have these additions in father
Hay's transcript. In two charters (printed at p. 209)
granted by Amelec and his brother Malduin Earl of
Iaennox, the common clause noticing the affixing of
the seal has been omitted by the engresser of the Re.
gister, and by father Hay's transcribet (p. 356-7.)
That the original charterS, however, had that clause,
is established by the transcript of the Chartulary of Len-
nox, where the same dccds occur, each with the words,
‘in cujus rei testimoninm sr'ffl'llum meum presenti
charte (confirmationis,) mee· est appensum‚’ afford-
ing a strong presumption that neither the original
chartei-s, nor any other earlier register of them, were
the source of father Hay's transcript. Numerous pe-
culiarities and inaccuracies of the rubrics of our MS.
are adopted by father Hay. Thus, a charter of Ro-
berlus Porler dominus tle Porterfield, containing a
grant of an annual rent from chfrew, is entitled in the
register Curta Roberti l’ortarjsield (p. 374⁷) and this
is the title given in Hay's MS. (p. 242.) although
it plainly could not be the indorsement of the original
charter. The grants of the chapel and land of Kil-
mor at Lochgilp in the Register, have the latter sylla-
hle ofthatname unifornily written in acontracted shape.
Hay's MS. always gives this Kilma, evidently mis-
taking the force of the abbreviation, but as it occurs
frequently, it can hardly be supposed to have been found
in that contracted shape invariably either in the original
chartei-s or in another Rogister. Again, the Chartulary
(p. 289.) has imitated the subscription of the Cluniae
notary who attests the bnlls of l’opes Clement and In-
nocent, and Hay has repeated a fac-simile ot'that sig-
nature as it appears in the Register. (Hay's MS. p.

The latter part of M‘Farlan's collection of Lennox
charte-rs, preserved in the Advocates' Library, is com-
posed of extracts froin the Chartulary of Paisley.
The references by the transcribet are to the pages of
father Hay's MS„ bnt that accurate collector having
afterwards, as it would seem, obtained access to the
Register then in the possession of the Earl of Dun-
donald, has marked in his own hand on the commence-
ment of his transcript, Collum cum autoy. Chat-ln-
lario, Sep. 17413, (p. 103.) Audin reference to achar-
ter of Earl Malduin, (p. 105.) he writes, ‘ This rom-
pared with the original Clmrtulary, 1763, Ch. Pas.

lay sollo recto 104: corresponding with the folio and
side on which this charter is entered in our Register.
In like manner the curious inquisition concerning the
lands of Monachkenneran is noted in M‘Farlan's hand,
(p. ll7,) ‘ Collata cum apographo penes comitem de
Dundonnld, uhi erlatsolio recto 10,‘ at which page
accordingly of the Register it is found. There is t
MS. note in a copy of David Stewart's History of the
Royal Family in the Advocates library (at page 56) in
M‘Farlan's writing, quoting a charter of King Robert
11. to the Abbey ot' Paisley, dated at Cluny 20111 Juiy
1361, with a. reference to Char. Paisley folio verso
amris, where 11 is found in our Register‚ (printed at
page 67.) There is no doubt, therefore, that this ac-
curate and well informed antiquary considered the Re.
gister then in the possession of Lord Dundouald, and
from which the present work is printed, as the original
of father Hay's transcript.

It would not have been necessary to point out at such
length the grounds for concluding Hay's third volume
of diplomata to be a transcript from onr Register, had
not some doubt been thrown on the fact by that person
himself. ln his letter to the ane of Perth, which he
thought it necessary to write in answer to Matthew
Kennedy's deduction of the royal family of Stewart
from the Milesian Irish, (Paris 1712,)-in his essay on
the origin of the royal family of the Stewarts, (Edin.
l722‚)—as well as in the vindication of Elizabeth More,
(printed at Edinburgh 1723), he has occasion fre-
quently to quote the Chartulary of Paisley, and his re-
ferences are carefully made to the pages of a Chartulary
in his own library, or as he is pleased occasionally to
term it, in bibliotheca Hayana, which he thus describes
in a note of the last work, p. 9. “ The Chartulary of
‘ Paisley extant in my library, contains the several
·“ deeds granted to that Monastery from the first foun-
‘ dation 10 Queen Mary's time. 'Tis a large folio,
‘ writ on paper in glorious characters. My Lord Dun-
‘ donald hath a copy thei-eof in 4to, yet not so full and
‘ ample as mine, transcribet! a little before the Refor-
( mation.” The references to the pages of his Char-
tulary correspond accurately with the pages of the tran-
script which forms, as above mentioned, one of the vo-
lumes of his collection of diplomata, and these are far
too numerous to be accounted for by a mere accidental
coincidence. As a Regis-ter of Paisley, it is certainly
not more full and ample than the Dundonald Register.
