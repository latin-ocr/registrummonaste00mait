IN bringing forward the first, and what from several causes may be esteemed one of
the most interesting, of the Scottish ChartularieS, it may be permitted shortly to ‹lraw
the attention of those who have not made them their study, to the information to be
derived from this class of records. Their historica] importance is very generally
admitted. The numerous charters of our earlier kings, not elsewhere preserved, and
those of persons only second to them in rank and interest, present the most authen-
tic materials of the history of a dark period, in which may be traced the foun-
dation and early progress of our remarkable constitution. Doubtful dates are fixed ;
the position and mutual relation of the actors on the historical stage arc ascertained ;
incidental mention occurs of contemporary historical events; if these authentic ‹loeu-
ments do not furnish a connected detail of affairs, they afford the surest means of testing
the accuraey of the accounts of the chronicler and annalist, and frequently the most
satisfactory correction of their errors. In the early history of all countries,—but espe-
cially of one whose history has been obseured not so much even by the loss of its
national reem-ds, as by the folly of writers attempting to supply that loss by fabulous
inventions,-—it is of the first consequence to assemble as a foundation all historical
facts, however trivial; and the collector will often be astonished to find these, singly
so unimportant‚ when placed together, arranging themselves in the lucid order and
full detail of true history. But, however necessary as a ground-work, the detail of
public events does not in truth form the most important part of the early history of a
people. To ascertain the first recognition of individual and national rights; to trace
the rising of the free husbandman out of the serf chained to the soil, and the growth of
societies for mutual support and protection against violence; to mark the steps of ad-
vancement towards complete security of property, and, dependent upon it, the rise of
commerce and the ingenious machinery devised for transferring and bequeathing wealth ς
to study the mutual relation between the sovereign and the subject, not merely as the
governor and the governed, but as the great lord of the soil aud the vassal bound 'oy
his tenure to do him service ; in a word, to observe the careful building up of the pile
of modern society, the antique and cumbrons decorations of which are now falling
fast asunder,—such are the legitimate objects of history, at a period when the motives
of the actm-5, the policy of statesmen, the causes of happy or adverse fortune, aud
the results of different lines of conduct, can hardly be guessed at,-—while the commonplace
historian finds nothing to record but a rapid and confused succession of questionable
kiugs, attempts of usurpers, wars of hostile nations marked by the usual details of vio-
lence and rapine, or battles of kindred tribes where each claims the victory, and where
now the chief dispute is who were the combatants.

The student who takes an extensive view of the field of early history, will not fail to
