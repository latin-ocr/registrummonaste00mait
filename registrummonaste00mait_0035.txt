it has been thought adviseable to insert it in the List, with the suggestion of a preferable
reading, which will serve at least to indicate that the apparent error of text has not
been the result of oversight or negligence. In a considerable number of instances,
while the words of the original have been suffered to remain, that which appeared to be
the true or more intelligible reading has been also inserted in the text, within brackets,
and frequently where the sense was incomplete, one or more words have been sup-
plied from a similar document occurring in a different part of the work, distinguished
in the same way by brackets, and as the reader has thus been put on his guard, the
introduction of these into the List of corrections has been deemed unnecessary.

The table of contents, printed accurately from the manuscript, has been as in the
original prefixed to the Register, and is made to serve the double purpose of a refe-
rence to the pages of the printed work, and the means of comparing them with the
corresponding folios of the original. With more questionable utility, the date, certain
or conjectural, or an approximation to the date of each charter, has been affixed
to its entry in the table, within brackets. These have been adjusted with considerable
care, and may be of use to the general reader. The more accurate investigator will
not take such facts on the authority of conjecture. Much is still wanting, and much
will assuredly be done by the researches of future antiquaries, and the publication of
other records, to facilitate and give accuracy to what is at present a laborious and
unsatisfactory process.

The Appendix consists of the charterx of Malcolm IV. granting to Walter fitz-
Alan the hereditary office of Steward, together with numerous lands which afforded
the subjects of his munificent benefactions to Paisley recorded in this volume ;-and of
two deeds,y of considerable intrinsic interest, relating to the tenure of the heritable

a: 1. It is printed from a collection in the hand-
wrinng of Sir James Balfour, preserved in the Har-
leian Library, (4693. fol. 45.) On the preceding folio
is the following note. ‘ leir subsequen! claarters I
‘ had out of ane litell manuscripto vrettin villa llze
ζ hund of Sir John Skeene clm-k Reqz'ster, copied hy
‘ him offthe principallcs.' It had already been print-
ed with more than his usual inaccuracy by Crawfurd,
(Fam. of Stewart, p. 2⁷..) and inore correctly by An-
drew Stewart, (His-l. os Secu-aris, p* 4.)—from the
same MS. although Crawfurd quotes it ambiguously,
as if he would have it believed he had seen the original
chax-ter.

y II. and 111. From a folio register on vellum,
consisting chiefly of the feu-charters granted by the
convent to the burgesses of Paisley, of borough tene.
ments, from 1489, the year after the erection of the
borough, tm 1547,-in the possession of Messieurs
u'ilson and Macintyre of Glasgow,-—fol. 100, 102.
This volume presents nothing else of general interest.

It may be proper to correct a popular mistake
regarding another record connected with the Mo.
nastery of Paisley. The Black Book· os Paisley,
quoted by Bucliauan and our earlier historians, and
which (having disappeared,) was raised by later anti.
quaries into undue importance as a distinct and origi-
ual chronicle, was nothing more than a copy os Fordun
with Bower's continuationi 11 appears to have been
acquired by Thomas Lord Fairfax, but when Gale and
Hearne wrote, had already been deposited in the Royal
Library, where it is still preserved, (13. E. X.) Hearne
particularly notices the inscription on this volume,—
‘ Iste liber est Sanctidacolai et Sancti Mirini (le Pas-
Ieto.' 111 describing its former possessor, the old non-
juror's partialities and prejudices are violently disturb-
ed3 but these never overcouie his honesty, and he
records the general of the armies of the Parliament as
the man of learning, and the patron and friend of
scholars and literatura—Praefatio ad Fordun, p. Levi.
