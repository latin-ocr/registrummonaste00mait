Then follow a series of deeds, chiefly by successive Bishops of St Andrews, confirming
to the Abbey the churches of Innerwic and Lygardwod‚ in Haddington and Ber-
wickshire‚oe aud the grant and confirmation of the church of Kilcolmanel in Cantyre. y

Those deeds ought perhaps to have. been followed by the charters and other docu-
ments relative to the Abbey's possession of the churches of Kilkeran (in Cantyre,) and
Kilfinan, and the chapel of the Virgin at Kilmory on Loehgilp3z but with natural
enough connexion, the compiler of the Chartulary has placed before the gift of the first
of these, the other charters granted by the family of the donor, in chronological series.
These charters of the Lords of the Isles, form what must generally be considered the
most interesting portion of the work, both from their intrinsic peculiarities, and from
the great family whose history they tend to illustrate.

The family of De Ins-ulis commands our interest, not more from its great power
and consequence, than from the impenetrable mystery which involves its origin, the
obscurity and doubt attending its extinction, and the clashing pretensions of the nume-
rous races which have pareelled out its possessions, to be held its descendants and repre-
sentatives. Exercising extensive sovereign power and frequently asserting a regal
style, those princes appear in history, at long intervals‚ treating almost 011 equal terms
with the greatest crowned heads, while in the intermediate times, their remote exis-
tence is marked only by the ravages of their fierce followers on every coast where a.
prey was to be taken. It is not to be hoped that any new light can be thrown on
the history of a race which has been so eagerly discussed, by the publication of a record
already so familiar to the historian and the genealogist as the Chartulary of Paisley2
but it may tend to the encreased accuracy of future discussions of the subject, to pre-
sent, in an authentic shape, charters of four successive generations of that great family.‹1

These chartei-s are also interesting from their substance and singular ternis, the
granters stipulating for a certain commodity of prayers in exchange for a penny an-
nually from every house from which smoke issues within their territories, while Fonia,
the wife of Reginam, grants to the Abbey‚ in an unusual manner, the tithe of all
property which God has given her, as well of those things which she. has for her own
use as of those which she sends by sea or land for sale ‚· and the assurance of payment,
as well as of brother-ly maintenance and protection‚ is enforced by an oath, (by Saint
Columba) that the party transgressing shall have the malediction of the granter.
In return, the liberal benefactor is to be admitted as a brother to the full privileges of
