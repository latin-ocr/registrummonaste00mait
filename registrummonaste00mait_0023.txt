XI

tulary of Paisley‚ contains several charterss which are also recorded in this Register.
In these there is no material discrepaney, while those slight varieties occur which
are considered by critics rather to confirm the genuineness of parallel records. On a
fly leaf at the end of a volume of original ancient charters, preserved in the Advo-
eates' Library, we find a copy, in the hand-writing of Thomas Ruddimau, of the char-
ter of Alan the Stewart (printed at p. 11.) aecompanied by the following attestation :
“ Edin. AIarch. ⁶20, 1705. This 18 ,filithf'ltlly copied (ff the original by me, leos.
Ruddiman.” Although that accurate person has unfortunately omitted to say where
the original was preserved, it is highly satisfactory to find that there is no difference
between this copy and our Register: even the contracted names of the witnesses are
in a similar shape in both, and the numerous names of lands, of which Ruddiman and
the Paisley scribe were probably equally ignorant, have undergone scarcely any varia-
tion. Again at page 403 of the Register‚ is a deeree of the Lords Auditors, professedly
extracted from the Registers of Parhament, which agrees in every thing with the decree
recorded in the books of Parliament recently published by authority.t Perhaps a
yet stronger proof of the general accuraey of our record is drawn from the occurrence
(p. ⁶278) of a bull of Calixtus II. in 1120, confirming the privileges of the Cluniae order,
which is also preserved in the Roman collection of bulls. When it is considered through
what a series of transcripts these two copies must be traced to their common original,
it is certainly snrprising to find that they afford only one or two discrepancies‚⁷⁴ ex-
cept in the spelling of a long list of French abbeys and bishoprics, which are almost
equally incorrect in both, and which it has therefore been thought allowable to eor-
rect from the accurate Mabillon's history of the Benedictine order.

These extensive materials, consisting of the muniments and evidences of the principal
transaetions in which the Abbey was concerned 'for nearly four centuries, or at least
that part by which it considered itself benefited, are arranged not quite so ‘promis-
cuously' as Crawfurd imagined, and as a hasty reader might at first sight be led to be-
lieve. The first twenty-one deedsv eonsist of the charters and confirmations relat-
ing to the foundation of the monastery, its change from a Priory to the government

Register appears to have adopted at least as good read·
iugs as the Bullatium. In two instances where they
differ materially, the Cl1artulary is unqucstionably the
more correct. At p. 279, l. 24, sine cluniacensis
abbatis precepto abbas nullatenus eligatur, is in the

r Cliarters of Earl Alwin. p. 157, of Maldwiu, p.
160, ofMalcolm, p. 203, 5³04, 205, of Amelech, p. 209,
and of Maldwin, p. ‘209 of the present work.
