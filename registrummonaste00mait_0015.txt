PREFACE.

THE Monastery of Paisley was founded about the year 1163‚12 by Walter the son
of Alan, first of that family Steward of Scotland, for monks of the Cluniae order of

reformed Benedictines brought from the Priory of Wenlock in Shropshire.

The order

of Cluny‚12 of high antiquity in Franco, was introduced into England soon after the

a The exact date of the foundation charter cannot
perhaps be ascertained with certainty. Crawford places
itin 1160, Hay in 1168, each without assigning any
reason. From the phrase, ‘ pro salute corporis et
anime reyis Alalcolmi‚' occurring in the charter‚ it is
evident that it was granted during Malcolrn's reign,
who succeeded in 1153. Of the witnesses, [ngelram
the chancellor became Bishop of Glasgow in 1164,
and was afterwards so styled in deeds; and Richard
the king's chaplain7 was elected Bishop of St. An-
drews in 1163, from which time he must have been
styled Electus if not Bishop, and would, in virtue of
that rank, have been placed higher in the list of wit.
nesses. The period in which the charter must neces-
sarily have been granted being thus narrowed7 a rea-
sonable conjecture is afforded of its exact date, by the
place at which t was granted. This is without doubt
Potheringhay in Nortliamptonshire, written Fodriyeia
in Doniesday and other old reeords, a castle and manor
inherited along with the Eaxldom of Huntingdon by
King Malcohn; and we know of no other occasion
within the time innited, which could bring together
at this castle the Chancellor and Stevvard of Scotland,
and the King's chapiaiu, persons usually in attendance
on the King, with other Scotchmen, except Mal-
colm's visit to England in 1163, when he did homage
to Henry ΙΙ. on the first day of July at V‘odsmlw, a
place not distant from his own Castle of Fotheringhay.

The Chronicle of Meli-os bears that Hunbandus
Prior de Wenloc adduavit conventum apud Passelet
qui estjnxta Rensriu, anno 1169. A suspicion of
the accuracy of the printed copy having arisen from
the old MS. transcript in the Advocates' Library,
assigning this as the year of the death of Hunbamlus
qui adduaeit conventum ιξρσ. the original in the Cotton

collection has been collated, and, in this instance, is
found to support the reading of Gale. The date, ifit
relates to the actual settlement of the monks at Paisley,
is not inconsistent with that assigned for the foundation
chax-ter above. The same authority records the death
of Aldred, Abbot of Rievalle, (who was witness of the
foundation charter‚) in 1107.

ἂ The order derived its name from the Abbey of
Cluni, in Bmgundy, the first and always the chief
house of the brotherhood. So magnificent was that
foundation, that after the first council of Lyons in
1245, we are told the Abbey received within its walls
at one time, the Pope, (Innoceut IV.) Baldwin Em-
petor of Constantiuople. the King of France (St Leuis)
and his mother, Robert Duke of Artois his brother,
Hugh Duke of Burgundy, the l‘rinces of Castile and
Arragon, the two Patriarchs of Constantinople and
Aminei), twelve cammah, three archbishops, fifteen
bishops, six εει-18, and many other great lords and ab·
bots,-and that without depriving the brethren of their
chambers, their refectory, chapter house, and other
ordinary apartments,

The Monastery of Wenlock was peopled from the
Priory of La Charite on the banks of the Loire, the
first in rank of the Priories of the Cluniae ordei-3 and
the perfectly organized subordination preserved through
all the institutions of this great society, rendered it ne-
cessary that the new colony should have the sanction
not only of its immediate parent, bnt of the mother
churcli, and the head of the order. For explanation
of one or two of the following documents, it may be
proper to mention that Bemo the founder of the order,
and St. Odo his successor in the Abbacy of Cluny‚
were held in especial respect and veneration by the
