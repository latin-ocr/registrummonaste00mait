XXIV

bailliary of the Regality of Paisley by Robert Master of SeznpilL afterwards third Lord
Sempffl, the powerful rival of the family of Abercorn for the spoils of the rich abbacy.³

An Index of the names of persons and places is added, which it is feared is not so
complete and correct as was to be desired.

It does not appear necessary to say much in defence of the anomaly (although contrary
to almost unbroken custom) of these prefatory remarks appearing in a different language
from the book to which they relate. Even when Latin was the only language of the
learned, and in the hands of those who wielded it as masters, it served but poorly to
express modern barbarous names and customs, and modes of thinking which we would
not willingly change for what is classical. It is needless to enquire whether this arose
from the singular unwieldiness of that language, οι· that nations must have common
principles of thought, feeling, and action, to render the language of the one fit for
expressing the sentiments of the other. The present work can hardly come into the
hands of foreigners, for whom it would have no interest; and now, when Latin is
superseded even in works of science by another and more universal tongue, it up-
proaches to affectation to cramp the free course of thought and give ambiguity to its
expression, by using a dead language, merely fr0m deference to old editorial usage.
