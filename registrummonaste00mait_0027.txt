was this a mere respectful form of words employed by a lordly benefactor, nor only
for the purpose of securing the prayers of a religious community. In those. times
of violence, it was an object, even for the highest, to provide a safe retreat for age
or adversity, and it was often held an advantageous investment of the. fruits of rapine
to purchase the means of devoting to a tardy penitenee the years unfit for violenceac

the chapel of Kilmorye at Lochgilp,l1 and a grant of timber from all his woods, for
building and repairing the Monastery, given by Donaldus Makgilcriste, Lord of Tar-

and tenure of the possessions of the Abbey in the Leunoxsl These, besides contributing
more thau any other source to our information concerning the great family of Lennox,
and illustrating the state of property within their wide territory, have fortunat‹·ly
preserved for the curious antiquary some of the most interesting specimens of early
legal procedure, which have come down to us iu Scotland. The litera emantimztiovix
de terra lllovmelzlsennarmz injuste alienata ε consists of a short, definite and formal! y
recorded declaration, (intentio, ) and of the evidence of a large body of witnesses strictly
eonfined to its proof with an accuracy worthy of a more advanced age3 and the J udges

Patrick Earl of Dunbar,—who‚ 111 the prospect of ap-
proaching death, assembled his childmn, relations and
neighbours to celebrate with him the joyous festivities
of Christmas, and after four days so spent, summoned
his friend and kinsman the Abbot of Meiros, assumed
the religious dress, received extreme unction, and,
bidding a last farewell to all, expired,——it would be
easy to collect numerous instances of fierce soldiers and
unscrupulous politicians retiring at last into the quiet
of the cloister. Walter l'Espec, the founder of Rie-
valle Abbey, took the monastic habit there two years
before his death in ll53.-Duyd. Μοιιιιεί. 1. 728.
Walter Fitz-Alau, Steward of Scotland, the founder
of Paisley, who had secured his admission to the
Cluniae order, and to the participation in the benetit
of their prayers and excreises, whether he should as-
sume the habit of the order or not, (p. 3.) eventually
died a monk of Meli-ose in 1177, to which house
he had also been a liberal benefactor. Richard de Mor-
11118, constable of Scmland, in his old age, retired
to the Abbey of Melrose, and died there in 1189.
Peter de Curri, already a considerable benefactor, in
1205, on the narrative that he had of divine suggestion
become a brother of the convent, and had been kindly
received by the Abbot, renounced all controversy which
formerly existed between thern and calling God and his

out similar instances. Henry de St Martin obtain<

when he should assume the religious habit there; and
his grant of those lands follows accordingly (p. 48, 411).

One other instance it would be inexcusable here to
omit. John Earl of ROSS, the last Lord of the Isles„
is said to have concluded his life of romantic adven-
