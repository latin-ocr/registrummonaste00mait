well-known antiquary. In the former q11otationS‚ the folios referred to coincide with
those of our Register: in the latter, the pages are those of F ather Hay's transcript‚
which seems to have been acquired by Macfarlan, and to have passed with his other
collections into the library of the Faculty of Advocates.

It is certain then that our manuscript is the same which has been consulted and
quoted by Scottish historical writers as the original and genuine Chartulary of Paisley3
and although it may be presumed that a house so old and wealthy must have had earlier
collections of its muniments, yet from the character in which it is written, approaching
so near to the date of many of the deeds recorded in it, any such older registers must
have been defective in comparison with this, which presents the charters and privileges
of the Monastery from its foundation till within a few years of its dissolution.

The record, unfortunately, by no means deserves to stand so high for accuracy
and care of formation, as it does for genuineness and authenticity. The scribe ern-
ployed was evidently ignorant of the language in which he wrote and careless of ortho-
graphy and of correctness of transcribing. In cases where the documents recorded are
liable to suspicion, perhaps his simplicity may be considered a favourable circumstance
in estimating his credibility. Fortunately there are still in our power other means of
judging of the general fidelity of this record. It has been already mentioned, that
Macfarlan's transcript of the Chartulary of Lennox, made before he had seen the Char-

tainly of very different dates, the one being in the reign
of Malcolrn, the other in that of william, (printed at
peges l and 5.) This blunder, arising probably from
loose and hasty notes of reading without after verify-
ing the references, may perhaps explain another error

charter of foundation, which happens singularly to
stand only second on the Record ς The chartei· of erec-
tion of the borough of barony of Paisley, occupies the
161 leaf of the Register certainly, but even this notice
regarding it is not altogether accurate, since it does

not cotnuience on that leaf, but on the folio preceding.
The statement, that ί then we have several grants by
the abbots to their vassals‚ brought down to the year
15⁴5: is wholly incorrect ς the record is not of grants
hythe Abbey, but of such as were made in its favour, and
it is only to record and explain some equivalent benefit
to the convent, that charters of the abbot are at au en-
grossed ; and the latest date of any deed occurs-ing in
the volume is 1529, (commissio regmlitatis, p. 435.)
if that be really a copy of an actual deed, drawn
with blanks fur the conimissioners' names, and not
rather a style inserted for convenience on a ily-leaf
of the Abbey Register. But these are venial euers,
when compared with the inaccuracy of some of Craw-
furd's after references and extr-acts from the Chartulary.
At page 3. of the History of the family of Stewart‚
speaking cf the foundation of the monastery, to which
he fixes a specific date without assigning any reason
or authority, he inserts what he calls the foundation
charter, ‘ which‚' says he, ‘ I transcribed from the
Register of that monastery, courteously afforded tue
by the favour of John Earl of Dundonahl! It is,
however, in reality, an inaccurate and awkward corn-
pound of two separate charters of the chartulary, cer-

of the author, where (at p. 6. of the History of Ren-
frew) he quotes the foundation charter as at fol. 3. of
the Chartuhry, on which leaf, according to his calcu-
lations in other cases, the latter of the two charters
which he has so strangely combined does occur though
connnencing on the previous page, but the foundation
charter is found on folio l.

r One circumstance may be thought to throw suspi-
cion even over the genuineness of this record. Several
of the chartei-s of Alan the second High Steward bear,
not only in the rubrics but in the body of the deeds,
the style of ί Alanus filius Walteri fundatoris, (as
at p. 13 and 14.) a designation which certainly, or at
least most probably, could not stand in the originals.
Perhaps the writer of this register, or of theprevious char-
tulary from which it was copied, anxious to distinguish
between the two Walter Fitz Alans, has added the
style which distinguished the first steward most satis-
factorily in the estimation of the monks of Paisley. It
is evident how much this was almed at, by the care-
ful marking which has been represented at p. 7l, l. l.
That the originals have been to this extent tampered
with, there can be little doubt.
