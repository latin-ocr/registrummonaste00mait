The connexion cxisting between the Abbeys of Paisley and Crosraguel, which led
to the insertion of the succeeding writs,k is somewhat obscure. It appears that Dun-
ean Earl of Carrio, (who was allied to Walter the first Steward by the marriage of
their children‚) founded and endowed the house of Crosraguel for monks of Paisley,
and so richly that the new colony aspired immediately to independence, while the
mother house endeavoured to keep it as a cell or oratorium to be enjoyed by brethren
of their convent, and under their immediate control. The dispute was ineffectually
referred to the Bishop of Glasgow as diocesan, and finally settled, probably by a papal
‹numnis-sion, which seems to have secui-ed the independence of Crosraguel, reserving to
Paisley a right of visitationl and three churches of Carric.m

After the writs relative to Crosraguel, there follow two bnlls, one by Benedict XI*
granting to the Abbot of Paisley the privilege of using the mitre, ring, and other epis-
copal insignia, and of granting the benediction after service in absence of a Bishop ς Μ
the other the duplicate of a bull of Pope Alexander III. which occurred previously, ⁰
and which is repeated only to give the additional authentication of the subscriptions of
the Pope and Ca1·dinals.p An instrument of the settlement of the marches between
Caldorhauch and the Abbey lands of Barst and two writs regarding property in Glas-
gow‚⁷” conclude the record of real deeds contained in the Register. The remain-

εἰει-,3 which are not contained in the original table of contents, appear rather to have. -

been styles, inserted for the convenience of reference on the blank leaves of the chartu-
lary, than copies of really existing documents.

Composed of such materials, free at least from all suspicion of wilful vitiation, the
chartulary of Paisley presents one important distinction and superiority over the greater
part of the registers of religious houses, in embodying the whole of the deeds recorded,
without omitting, as in too many cases, the conclusions of charters and their witnesses.
This is not merely serviceable in aiding the researches of geuealogists. In charters of
high antiquity, where «lates are rarely given, it furuishes the only means of approxi-
mating to the time of granting the deed, and, which is even a higher advantage, fur-
nishes numerous criteria by which to detect any imposition, and to establish the authen-
ticity of genuine documents. So successfully has the study of this department of an-
tiqnities been prosecuted iu France and in England, that probably no charter with a
long list of witnesses can be so ingenious-ly forged as to escape detection, and although
the same degree of learning has not been brought to bear upon Scottish diplomacy,
and many of the tests are lost in the formation of a register, yet great additional
weight must in all cases attend a chartei· where the witnesses are fully expres-sed.
