convent intentionem suam sufficienter probasses A still more interesting document
10 the Scottish legal antiquary is the brief and retour of the inquest concerning the
succession of Dugald of Lennox‚9 which carries back to the reign of Alexander the
third, a very peculial· and accurate form of procedure, and altogether without that con-
nexion with church-courts, to which in general may be traced the early introduc-tion of
legal technicalities in a remote and otherwise barbarous country.

After the Lennoxdeeds follow documents and evidences of the possession of the church-
es of Dundonald, Sanchar, Auchinlec, Kyllenan, Prestwic,h Cragymi and Largis ; j
transactions between the Abbey and the borough of Renfrewst· an early charter of Mal-
colm granted to the Monks, apparently before their settlement at Paisley,l probably
placed here from its containing a right of fishing, and followed immediately by other
grants of fisl1ings.m

These are succeeded by Royal chartei-s of Lochwynnochu and Hastendean 3⁰ Royal
confirmations with encreased extent of the Abbey jurisdiction and privileges ;Ρ and by
the papal commission, the deliverance of the commissioners, the crown charter, and the
charter of the Abb0t‚ with other deeds relative to the erection of the borough of Regality
of Paisley.q

The next class consists of papal bulls and rescripts, granting or confirming the pri-
vileges of the Cluniae orders followed by those granted particularly to Paisley‚s and
by a great mass of documents, relating to the clashing jurisdictions of the Abbot aud
the Bishop of his diocese, in which the regulation of the stipends payable to the vicars
of the churches belonging to the Abbey,t the promuations and other episcopal duesu
and the precise extent of the Bishop's jurisdiction over the Monastery and its churehes, v
are the prominent subjects. This, which the monks undoubtedly considered as one of
the most important parts of their collection of muniments, and which may perhaps now be
generally regarded as altogether uninteresting, is not to be passed over lightly by the
student of Scottish antiquities. The history of the Church, with which the history of the
middle ages is so much bound up that the study of the one must be imperfect without
3 knowledge of the other, presente nothing more remarkable than the struggles for su-
periority between the 3003131· clergy and the monastic orders, that well-organized and
‹lisciplined militia of the papal power, which fought its battles and at length established
its supremacy all over Europe. The commencement of parochial divimus, the first
oudowment of churches‚ the original appropriation of tithes, the history of patronage
