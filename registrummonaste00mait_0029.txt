and of episcopal jurisdicti0n‚ which are illustrated by this partos the Register, are sub-
jects worthy of a more accurate and learned investigation than has yet been directed
towards Scottish antiquities.

Three charters of Auchinleek‚w which follow immediately after the great body of do-
cuments regarding the Abbey privileges and exemptions, are strongly characteristic of
a fierce and lawless age. They are succeeded by charters of an annual rent of Russal-
land, a right of water-course through Adamt0n‚ a gift osan annual payment of wax
by Hugh Boyl Lord of Byseholm and John Kelsow of Kelsowland, with numerous
confirmations of these classed togetherw after which are recorded charters of Howst01111‚y
of borough lands of Renfrewv and Rntliglen,a and of small possessions in Polloc.
Mernes,b and Stewa1·dt0n.c

These are followed by a series, if possible still more uninteresting to all but the
zealous local antiquary2 of the evidences of property in several tenements in Glasgowst
after which we find three deeds relative to a grant by Walter ΙΙ. of a rent charge to
the Convent of St Mary of Syxle‚e which probably came to the Abbey of Paisley
along with the other possessions of the Gilbertines in Scotland. This is the subject of
a deed occurring earlier in the Registe1·,s and these cannot be considered uninteresting,
if they shall be held to give an additional fact to the evidence of the Steward's con-
nexion with Eugland.

The Scottish documents immediately following, relate to certain disputes between the
Abbey of Paisley and the Borough of Renfrew‚ concerning customs claimed by the
borough within the town of Pais-lew and the landmeres or marches, which divided
their respective lands and jurisdictionsfi Then follows another series of papal bnlls
granted in favour of Paisley, some of which are interesting as forming the earliest re-
cords of the united property and of the privileges of the monastery, and occasionally,
as if designed to gratify after antiquafies, expressing the names of the donors of the dis-
serent lands and churchcs confi1·med.²'

to exist in the charter- chest of the Marquis of Aber-
corn, bnt the editor has not had an opportunity of col-
lating them. It is believed that no account nor tradi*
tion has been preserved of the motive for the mutilation

ι recorded and atoned for in these curious grants-

If ever tbe disputed on'gin of the Stewarts shall be
established as a certainty, it will probably be from some
ofthe records ofEnglish religious homes, of which such
abundant stores are still preserved, rather than from
Scottish sources·

i P. 407-421. One of these possessionS,—the carru-
cate of land called Tibiror apud chmals in Hibernia
(p. 412.) granted by the Earl of Canic, is worthy of
investigation by the Irish antiquary. It may possibly
be at Dunamase in the Queen's County‚ an early set-
tlement of the De Lacy's7 who were connected with the
Lords of Gauoway by marriage. The Abbey of Duri--
drenan in Galloway, (which Archdall is pleased to
place in the county Galway, Ireland,) had lands by
their gift in Mearh.
